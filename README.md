* **Angular** will be responsible for the front-end application (presentation/UI) which will be a Single-Page application.  
* **Express/Node** will be responsible for the server-side, will be that one that handles the business logic, accesses the database, processes requests and responses, etc. Express is simply a Node framework that simplifies writing server-side code and logic.  
* **MongoDB** will be responsible for serving as a database. MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database. NoSql databases are good when there isn't exact relationships among data.
